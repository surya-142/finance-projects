IME DA Comp 2 - Surya Venugopal, 2nd year, Industrial Engineering
In this folder, I have included a python jupyter notebook file which I used for all of the computation necessary, as well as the csv file provided and a csv file I generated from the data. All of my work is displayed if you open it in Jupyter, but in order for the code to work (mainly to get the csv file uploads to work) it needs to be run in Google Colab. I have also included an excel spreadsheet which includes some steps I took to document my thought process before coding, as well as the Completed Investment Outline and Write Up.Â
