Welcome to the Optimal Stock Investment Strategy project, a winning entry from a college competition! This project showcases one of my first Python endeavors, where I leveraged my knowledge of linear programming, pandas, and NumPy to develop a powerful solution.

In the competition, participants were provided with historical stock data featuring arbitrary tickers, along with budget and allocation constraints. The task at hand was to determine a strategy that would maximize the returns over a given period.

Drawing upon my programming skills and understanding of linear programming principles, I devised a function that generated the best objective solution. By leveraging the capabilities of pandas and NumPy, I analyzed the historical data, optimized the allocation of funds across different stocks, and calculated the most effective investment strategy within the given constraints.

Not only did this project provide an excellent opportunity to apply my Python knowledge, but it also allowed me to demonstrate my problem-solving abilities and aptitude for data-driven decision-making. Winning the competition in the department was a remarkable validation of the effectiveness of the solution I developed.

I invite you to explore this project and discover the intricacies of optimizing stock investment strategies. Although it originated from a competition, the concepts and techniques utilized here can be applicable in real-world scenarios. By diving into the code and exploring the logic behind the optimal allocation of funds, you can gain insights into the power of data analysis and optimization techniques in the financial domain.
