# finance-projects

Welcome to my Finance Projects repository! Here, I share some of the finance projects I've been working on over the years. These projects represent my ongoing exploration of various topics in finance. While some projects are still a work in progress, I believe in sharing my learning journey to demonstrate my commitment to professional growth.

By sharing these projects, I aim to showcase my thought process, problem-solving skills, and ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. Through hands-on implementation and analysis, I delve into the intricacies of volatility forecasting, portfolio optimization and related topics. Each project represents a stepping stone in my continuous quest to deepen my knowledge and expertise.

Whether you are a fellow finance enthusiast, a potential employer, or simply curious about the financial industry, I invite you to explore these projects. Your feedback, suggestions, and collaboration are greatly appreciated as I strive to refine my skills.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey!
