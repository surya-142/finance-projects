# finance-projects

This is a repository to share some of the finance projects I have built up over the years. Many of these are a work in progress, but I want to share them here anyways to show people what I have been thinking about.

Most recently, I have been looking to learn more about option pricing and volatility. My most recent projects highlight the learning I have committed to as I seek a job in the financial industry.
